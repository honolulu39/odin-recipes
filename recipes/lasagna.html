      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Lasagna is a culinary symphony, a grand architectural feat of comfort food that is as satisfying to behold as it is to consume. It is a masterpiece of layered composition, a celebration of texture, and a testament to the art of patient assembly. Unlike a fleeting dish, lasagna is a commitment, a journey of flavors that slowly meld and deepen with every minute it spends in the oven.

      At its heart, lasagna is a ballet of three core elements: the delicate, rippled pasta sheets that serve as the foundation; a rich, slow-simmered ragù or a vibrant vegetable filling that provides the savory core; and a creamy, luxurious béchamel or a blend of ricotta and mozzarella cheeses that binds everything together in a velvety embrace. The elegance lies not in a single ingredient but in the harmonious interplay of all three. The pasta becomes tender yet still holds its shape, the filling offers a robust and complex flavor, and the cheese melts into golden, bubbling perfection.</p>

      <h2>Ingredient</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pasta: Wide, flat pasta sheets, either fresh or dried. "No-boil" lasagna sheets are a popular modern convenience, but traditional lasagna often requires pre-boiling the sheets.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>For the Ragù (Meat Sauce):</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Ground meat, typically a mixture of ground beef and pork.</li>
          <li>Onion, carrots, and celery (a classic Italian "soffritto").</li>
          <li>Garlic cloves.</li>
          <li>Canned crushed tomatoes.</li>
          <li>Tomato paste.</li>
          <li>Dry red wine (optional, but adds depth).</li>
          <li>Herbs such as fresh or dried oregano, basil, and a bay leaf.</li>
          <li>Olive oil.</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        
        <li>For the Béchamel (White Sauce):</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Butter.</li>
            <li>All-purpose flour.</li>
            <li>Milk.</li>
            <li>Nutmeg (a crucial, traditional spice for béchamel).</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li>For the Cheese Layer:</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
            <li>Fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced or shredded.</li>
            <li>Ricotta cheese (optional, but a common addition for a lighter, creamier layer).</li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
      </ul>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Soffritto: In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat a generous drizzle of olive oil over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onion, carrots, and celery. Sauté gently until softened, about 8-10 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Brown the Meat: Add the ground beef and pork to the pot. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook, breaking up the meat with a spoon, until it is browned all over.</li>
        <li>Simmer the Sauce: Stir in the tomato paste and cook for one minute. If using, pour in the red wine and scrape the bottom of the pan to deglaze. Add the crushed tomatoes, herbs (oregano, bay leaf), salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it gently simmer for at least 1-2 hours. The longer it simmers, the richer the flavor.</li>
        <li>Make a Roux: In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the all-purpose flour to create a smooth paste (a roux). Cook for 1-2 minutes to cook out the raw flour taste.</li>
        <li>Add Milk: Gradually pour in the milk, whisking constantly to prevent lumps.</li>
        <li>Thicken and Season: Continue to whisk as the mixture comes to a gentle simmer and thickens. Once it coats the back of a spoon, remove from the heat. Stir in a pinch of nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat and Prep: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). If using dried lasagna sheets that require boiling, cook them according to package instructions and lay them out on a clean towel.</li>
        <li>Cover: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake: Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest: Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for at least 15-20 minutes before slicing. This is a crucial step to allow the layers to set, making it much easier to serve a clean, elegant slice.</li>
      </ol>
